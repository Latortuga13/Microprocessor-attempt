MemoryPull is a custom-built register-register/load-store architecture optimized for simplicity in design and complexity in instruction management. With only 4 general-purpose registers and 32 instruction slots, MemoryPull emphasizes memory interaction through direct addressing and limited register use. The guiding philosophy is to make the most of a large instruction set and minimal registers, which encourages frequent use of memory during computations.
